# Minishell_linux

This is a implementation in C of a minimalist linux shell using 

to run it just execute makefile and then
./minishell

## Description

This a a 2 hours project to recreate a MiniShell in C using system function. Actualy the shell works, but still call real function (such as ls, cat, mv, etc ...) even if a recode in C most of them. You can have a look at functions and C.

A improvement would be that the shell call hand-made functions. 

There are probably mistakes, moreover there aren't any comments in the code, it my not be clear at all. But let me know if you have questions.
